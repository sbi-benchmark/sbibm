    """Runs SMC-ABC from `sbi`

    SMC-ABC supports two different ways of scheduling epsilon:
    1) Exponential decay: eps_t+1 = epsilon_decay * eps_t
    2) Distance based decay: the new eps is determined from the "epsilon_decay"
        quantile of the distances of the accepted simulations in the previous population. This is used if `distance_based_decay` is set to True.

    Args:
        task: Task instance
        num_samples: Number of samples to generate from posterior
        num_simulations: Simulation budget
        num_observation: Observation number to load, alternative to `observation`
        observation: Observation, alternative to `num_observation`
        population_size: If None, uses heuristic: 1000 if `num_simulations` is greater
            than 10k, else 100
        distance: Distance function, options = {l1, l2, mse}
        epsilon_decay: Decay for epsilon; treated as quantile in case of distance based decay.
        distance_based_decay: Whether to determine new epsilon from quantile of
            distances of the previous population.
        ess_min: Threshold for resampling a population if effective sampling size is
            too small.
        initial_round_factor: Used to determine initial round size
        batch_size: Batch size for the simulator
        kernel: Kernel distribution used to perturb the particles.
        kernel_variance_scale: Scaling factor for kernel variance.
        use_last_pop_samples: If True, samples of a population that was quit due to
            budget are used by filling up missing particles from the previous
            population.
        algorithm_variant: There are three SMCABC variants implemented: A, B, and C.
            See doctstrings in SBI package for more details.
        save_summary: Whether to save a summary containing all populations, distances,
            etc. to file.
        sass: If True, summary statistics are learned as in
            Fearnhead & Prangle 2012.
        sass_fraction: Fraction of simulation budget to use for sass.
        sass_feature_expansion_degree: Degree of polynomial expansion of the summary
            statistics.
        lra: If True, posterior samples are adjusted with
            linear regression as in Beaumont et al. 2002.
        lra_sample_weights: Whether to weigh LRA samples
        kde_bandwidth: If not None, will resample using KDE when necessary, set
            e.g. to "cv" for cross-validated bandwidth selection
        kde_sample_weights: Whether to weigh KDE samples


    Returns:
        Samples from posterior, number of simulator calls, log probability of true params if computable
